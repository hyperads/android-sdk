## User segmentation [alpha]

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits. You can build custom (or use predefined) segments from your users. This is potentially increase your monetization. 

For building segments based on in-app events you need to notify our backend for every event occured in your app.

Events sending is made very easy. Just call the method `sendEvent(Context, "YOUR_TOKEN", event_code)` from `HADEvent` class.

For example:

```java

 HADEvent hadEvent = new HADEvent(this);
        hadEvent.setToken("TOKEN");
        hadEvent.sendEvent(Event.ECOMMERCE_PURSHASE);
        
        // Or just
        
        HADEvent.sendEvent(this, "TOKEN", Event.GAMING_ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED); //That's all!

```
